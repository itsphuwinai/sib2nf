        <h2>Origins and History</h2>
        <p>
            For over two thousand years, the carnation has been a quiet witness to history, its petals carrying whispers of love and remembrance. In ancient Greece and Rome, it was cherished for its gentle fragrance and delicate form, often woven into crowns that graced solemn ceremonies. Its name is believed to stem from the Latin <em>corone</em>—a tribute to the flower garlands that adorned rituals, hearts, and time itself.
