                <i>"In the next one, will you find me?
                I'll be the boy with the pink carnation pinned to my lapel
                Who looks like hell and asks for help

            Some things never quite leave you. A lyric, a color, a fleeting feeling. For me, it was a single line—one I wasn't searching for, yet it found me. And with it, carnations.
            There's something about them: soft, yet unwavering. Fragile, yet enduring. A quiet presence, like the memories we carry without realizing.
            I never thought a song would lead me here, but now carnations feel like a reflection of myself. The way they bloom unhurriedly, the way their petals hold onto color long after other flowers fade—there's a kind of solace in that.
            I've always believed flowers speak in ways we cannot. Perhaps that's why I'm drawn to them. Perhaps that's why I'm here, writing this.
            Pink carnations are said to symbolize gratitude and remembrance. They remind me to hold onto what matters, to notice the quiet details, to find beauty in the smallest moments. And somehow, without meaning to, they have become part of my story.
